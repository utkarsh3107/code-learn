/**
 * Prior to Java 5, java memory model had a lot of issues and above approaches used to fail in 
 * certain scenarios where too many threads try to get the instance of the Singleton class simultaneously. 
 * So Bill Pugh came up with a different approach to create the Singleton class using a inner static helper class. The Bill Pugh Singleton implementation goes like this;
 * 
 * Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the singleton class. When the singleton class 
 * is loaded, SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance method, 
 * this class gets loaded and creates the Singleton class instance. This is the most widely used approach for 
 * Singleton class as it doesn’t require synchronization. I am using this approach in many of my projects and 
 * it’s easy to understand and implement also.
